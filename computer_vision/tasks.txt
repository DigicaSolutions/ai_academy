Analyze labels distribution
!! Read images and labels and display images
Use only the non-multiclass samples  in the training

Train a baseline model
!! Train a pretrained model

!! Generate saliency maps to check whether the model uses correct spots to
classify images

!! Save generated images in separate folders and check whether they are correctly
generated

Add augmentations

Analyze performance in tensorboard

!! Check whether you can detect diseases manually - use opencv functions to detect edges, blobs, itp.

Change images to grayscale and check the difference in results

Compute mean and std by hand
!! Use commonly used mean and std

Use smart resize

Use class weights
